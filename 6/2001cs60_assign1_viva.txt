TABLES:

1. COMPANY
	Name(primary key)

2. TASK
	Description(primary key)

3. STAFF
	id(primary key)
	dob
	age
	name
	Company_name(foreign key references COMPANY(Name))
	Since
	Wife_name

4. Phone
	id(foreign key references STAFF(id))
	Phone
	-primary key (id, Phone)

5. Address
	id(foreign key references STAFF(id))
	Address
	-primary key (id, Address)

6. CHILD
	id(foreign key references STAFF(id))
	name
	-primary key (id, name)

8. Perform
	id(foreign key references STAFF(id))
	Description(foreign key references TASK(Description))
	-primary key(id, Description)


Here, 8 tables are formed
but number of tables could be minimized
for example
STAFF:
	id(primary key)
	dob
	age
	mane
	Wife_name
	Child_name(multi-valued)
	Phone(multi-valued)
	Address(multi-valued)
	Company_name
	Since
	Task_description(multi-valued)
So, minimum number of tables can be 1
but it will create problems
